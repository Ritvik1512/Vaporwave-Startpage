# Vaporwave-Startpage
Vaporwave themed startpage

#Firefox setup
 
move the file to

C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\browser

This will ask for admin privileges

Then, in firefox go to the URL "about:preferences"

and put "file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Mozilla%20Firefox/browser/vaporwave.html" - as homepage

make sure the dropdown menu above says 'show my homepage', and you're golden.

#Chrome setup:

move the file to

C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome - it can be anywhere, but I chose to put it there because why the fuck not.

Then, in Chrome go to the URL "chrome://settings/"

Under the 'On startup' section, choose the 'Open a specific set of pages....'

It will now ask you to enter a URL, input:

file:///C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/Google/Chrome/vaporwave.html

restart, and voila

#For anything else:

install chrome or firefox, ya dingus
